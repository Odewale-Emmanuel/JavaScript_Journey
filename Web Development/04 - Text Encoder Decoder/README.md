# `Text Encoder Decoder`

___
This piece of code `encodes` or `decodes` a given peice of text by `shifting` them `up` or `down` the ASCII Table. With user defined `shift range` between `-25` and `+25`. You might think it's easily crackable due to the predifined range. Yes, but imagine encoding a text that has already been encoded, more than once 😒😁😏
